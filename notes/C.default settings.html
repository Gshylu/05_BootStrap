    Bootstrap 5 uses a default font-size of 1rem (16px by default), and its line-height is 1.5.
    
    In addition, all <p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).
    Bootstrap 5 styles HTML headings (<h1> to <h6>)  with a bolder font-weight and a responsive font-size.
    
    
    
    <Text Colors></Text>
    
    Bootstrap 5 has some contextual classes that can be used to provide "meaning through colors".
    
    The classes for text colors are: .text-muted, .text-primary, .text-success, .text-info, .text-warning, .text-danger, .text-secondary, .text-white, .text-dark, .text-body (default body color/often black) and .text-light:>
    You can also add 50% opacity for black or white text with the .text-black-50 or .text-white-50 classes:
    
    <The classes for background colors are:></The> .bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light.
    
    Note that background colors do not set the text color, so in some cases you'll want to use them together with a .text-* color class.>
