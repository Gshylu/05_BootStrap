<containers>

    Bootstrap 5 also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.
    
    There are two container classes to choose from:
    
    <The .container = class provides a responsive fixed width container>
    Note that its width (max-width) will change on different screen sizes:
    
     
    <576px	Extra small = 100%
    ≥576px	Small= 540px max-width
    ≥768px	Medium= 720px max-width
    ≥992px	Large Large=960px max-width
    ≥1200px Extra  =1140x max-width
    ≥1400px  XXL =1320px max-width></576px>
    
    
    <the container-fluid></the>
     class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport (width is always 100%):
    
    
    <Container Padding></Container>
    By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. For example, .pt-5 means "add a large top padding":>
    
    <Responsive Containers>
    .container-sm|md|lg|xl classes to determine when the container should be responsive.>
    
    
    <Grid System>
    Bootstrap's grid system is built with flexbox and allows up to 12 columns across the page.
    
    If you do not want to use all 12 columns individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns:
    
    The grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size.
    
    Make sure that the sum adds up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns).
    
    <Grid class  has 6 classes > 
     col/col-sm-/col-md/col-lg/col-xl/col-xxl>>
     The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.
    
     <Tip: Each class scales up, so if you want to set the same widths for sm and md, you only need to specify sm.></Tip:>
