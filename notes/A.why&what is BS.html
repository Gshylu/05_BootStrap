To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following meta tag inside the head element:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
>>The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
