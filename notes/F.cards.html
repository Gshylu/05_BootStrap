<cards>
    A card in Bootstrap 5 is a bordered box with some padding around its content. It includes options for headers, footers, content, colors, etc.

 <Basic Card class="card" class="card-body">
    A basic card is created with the .card class, and content inside the card has a .card-body class:

<Header class="card-header" and Footer  class="card-footer">
    The .card-header class adds a heading to the card and the .card-footer class adds a footer to the card:

<Contextual Cards>
To add a background color the card, use contextual classes (.bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light.

<Titles, text, and links>

( class="card",class="card-body",class="card-title", class="card-text", <a href="#" class="card-link">)
    Use .card-title to add card titles to any heading element. The .card-text class is used to remove bottom margins for a <p>
         element if it is the last child (or the only one) inside .card-body. The .card-link class adds a blue color to any link, and a hover effect.

<Card Images >
     
    <img class="card-img-top" src="img_avatar1.png" alt="Card image")>
    Add .card-img-top or .card-img-bottom to an <img> to place the image at the top or at the bottom inside the card.
     Note that we have added the image outside of the .card-body to span the entire width:     

 
<Card Image Overlays class="card-img-overlay">
    Turn an image into a card background and use .card-img-overlay 
    to add text on top of the image:
