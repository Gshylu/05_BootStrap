<Navigation Bars>
A navigation bar is a navigation header that is placed at the top of the page:


<Basic Navbar>
With Bootstrap, a navigation bar can extend or collapse, depending on the screen size.

A standard navigation bar is created with the .navbar class, followed by a responsive collapsing class: .navbar-expand-xxl|xl|lg|md|sm (stacks the navbar vertically on xxlarge, extra large, large, medium or small screens).

To add links inside the navbar, use either an <ul> element (or a <div>) with class="navbar-nav". Then add <li> elements with a .nav-item class followed by an <a> element with a .nav-link class:

<Vertical Navbar>
Remove the .navbar-expand-* class to create a navigation bar that will always be vertical:

<Centered Navbar class="navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-light justify-content-center">
    Add the .justify-content-center class to center the navigation bar:

<Colored Navbar>
    Use any of the .bg-color classes to change the background color of the navbar (.bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light)
    Tip: Add a white text color to all links in the navbar with the .navbar-dark class, or use the .navbar-light class to add a black text color.

<Active/disabled state  class="navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-light navbar-light">
     Add the .active class to an  element to highlight the current link, or the .disabled class to indicate that the link is un-clickable.>

<Brand & Logo class="navbar-brand">
The .navbar-brand class is used to highlight the brand/logo/project name of your page:>

When using the .navbar-brand class with images, Bootstrap 5 will automatically style the image to fit the navbar vertically.
(   <img src="logo.png" alt="Avatar Logo" style="width:40px;" class="rounded-pill"> )


<Navbar Text class="navbar-text">
Use the .navbar-text class to vertical align any elements inside the navbar that are not links (ensures proper padding and text color).


 <collapsible navigation bar>
    use a button with class="navbar-toggler", data-bs-toggle="collapse" and data-bs-target="#thetarget". Then wrap the navbar content (links, etc) inside a <div> element with class="collapse navbar-collapse", followed by an id that matches the data-bs-target of the button: "thetarget"

<Tip: You can also remove the .navbar-expand-md class to ALWAYS hide navbar links and display the toggler button.

></Tip:>
<Navbar With Dropdown class="dropdown-menu">
    Navbars can also hold dropdown menus:

<Navbar Forms and Buttons>
    You can also include forms inside the navigation bar:

<Fixed Navigation Bar class="navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-dark navbar-dark fixed-top">
    The navigation bar can also be fixed at the top or at the bottom of the page.

    A fixed navigation bar stays visible in a fixed position (top or bottom) independent of the page scroll.
    
    The .fixed-top class makes the navigation bar fixed at the top:
    
    
    >>Use the .fixed-bottom class to make the navbar stay at the bottom of the page:

<sticky-top  class="navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-dark navbar-dark sticky-top">
 class to make the navbar fixed/stay at the top of the page when you scroll past it.
  Note: This class does not work in IE11 and earlier (will treat it as position:relative).>
