<Alerts (class="alert alert-success">)
    Alerts are created with the .alert class, followed by one of the contextual classes.alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning, .alert-danger, .alert-primary, .alert-secondary, .alert-light or .alert-dark:
    
    
             
    
    <Closing Alerts> 
    
    To close the alert message, add a .alert-dismissible class to the alert container. Then add class="btn-close" and data-bs-dismiss="alert"
    to a link or a button element (when you click on this the alert box will disappear).
    <Animated Alerts>
    The .fade and .show classes adds a fading effect when closing the alert message:>>
    
    <Why do we put a # in the href attribute of the link?>
    
    Since we do not have any page to link it to, and we do not want to get a "404" message, we put # as the link. In real life it should of course been a real URL to the "Search" page.

    <Button Outline(class="btn btn-outline-primary")>
    Move the mouse over them to see an additional "hover" effect:

    <Button Sizes>
    Use the .btn-lg class for large buttons or .btn-sm class for small buttons:
    
    <Block Level Buttons( class="btn btn-primary btn-block">)>
    To create a block level button that spans the entire width of the parent element, use the .d-grid "helper" class on the parent element:
    If you have many block-level buttons, you can control the space between them with the .gap-* class:(class="d-grid gap-3">
    )
    
    <Active/Disabled Buttons>
    A button can be set to an active (appear pressed) or a disabled (unclickable) state:>
    
    <Spinner Buttons( class="spinner-border spinner-border-sm">)
    You can also add "spinners" to a button, 
    
    <Badges<span class="badge bg-secondary"></span>)
    
    Badges are used to add additional information to any content:
    Use the .badge class together with a contextual class (like .bg-secondary) within <span> elements to create rectangular badges. Note that badges scale to match the size of the parent element (if any):
    
    <Contextual Badges (class="badge bg-primary")>
    
    <Pill Badges:(class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">)
    
    Primary Secondary Success Danger Warning Info Light Dark
    Use the .rounded-pill class to make the badges more round:
    
    they aslo used inside the element like buttons
    
    
    <Spinners class="spinner-border">
    To create a spinner/loader, use the .spinner-border class:
    
    <Colored Spinners class="spinner-border text-primary">
    Use any text color utilites to add a color to the spinner:
    
    <Growing Spinners  class="spinner-grow text-muted">>
    Use the .spinner-grow class if you want the spinner/loader to grow instead of "spin":
    
    <Spinner Size class="spinner-border spinner-border-sm" class="spinner-grow spinner-grow-sm">
    Use .spinner-border-sm or .spinner-grow-sm to create a smaller spinner:
    
    Loading.. Loading..
    
    <Spinner Buttons class="spinner-border spinner-border-sm" >
    You can also add spinners to a button, with or without text:
