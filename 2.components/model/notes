Add animation
Use the .fade class to add a fading effect when opening and closing the modal:


<!-- Fading modal -->
<div class="modal fade"></div>

<!-- Modal without animation -->
<div class="modal"></div>

Modal Size
Change the size of the modal by adding the .modal-sm class for small modals, .modal-lg class for large modals, or .modal-xl for extra large modals.

Add the size class to the <div> element with class .modal-dialog:
    <div class="modal-dialog modal-sm">
        <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg">
            <div class="modal-dialog modal-xl">By default, modals are "medium" in size.


Centered Modal
Center the modal vertically and horizontally within the page, with the .modal-dialog-centered class: 
<div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-centered">
    
    
Scrolling Modal
When you have a lot of content inside the modal, a scrollbar is added to the page. See the examples below to understand it:
<div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-scrollable">
